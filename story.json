  "title": "Railworks Copilot - Field Engineer AI Agents",
  "summary": "A mobile and desktop copilot for field engineers combining knowledge graphs, retrieval, and planning agents to speed diagnosis and resolution.",
  "problem": "Field engineers rely on fragmented documentation (PDFs, manuals, tickets) and inconsistent expertise, causing long diagnosis times, duplicated work, and slow onboarding.",
  "solution": "Built a multi-agent AI copilot that combines a Neo4j-based knowledge graph, retrieval-augmented search, and a planner/actor agent. Integrated with CMDB, ServiceNow, IoT telemetry, and imaging to provide step-by-step guidance, automated ticket triage, and contextual recommendations.",
