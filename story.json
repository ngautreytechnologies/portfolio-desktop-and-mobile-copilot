  "title": "Railworks Copilot - Field Engineer AI Agents",
  "overview": "A mobile and desktop copilot for field engineers combining knowledge graphs, retrieval, and planning agents to speed diagnosis and resolution.",
  "keyFeatures": [
    "Knowledge graph (Neo4j) consolidating docs, tickets, and asset relationships",
    "Retrieval layer with vector embeddings (FAISS/Pinecone)",
    "Planner agent for task decomposition and tool selection",
    "Mobile copilot UI with offline sync",
    "Integrations with ticketing, CMDB, and IoT telemetry"
  ],
  "pros": [
    "Reduced diagnosis time from 120 to 12 minutes",
    "Lower escalation by 60%",
    "Rapid adoption by engineers"
  ],
  "cons": [
    "Integrating heterogeneous data sources is complex",
    "Ensuring safe and verifiable agent actions",
    "Offline-first synchronization adds complexity"

  "problem": "Field engineers rely on fragmented documentation (PDFs, manuals, tickets) and inconsistent expertise, causing long diagnosis times, duplicated work, and slow onboarding.",
  "solution": "Built a multi-agent AI copilot that combines a Neo4j-based knowledge graph, retrieval-augmented search, and a planner/actor agent. Integrated with CMDB, ServiceNow, IoT telemetry, and imaging to provide step-by-step guidance, automated ticket triage, and contextual recommendations.",
  "timeline": "2023-09 - 2024-02",
  "impact": {
    "metrics": {
      "diagnosis time reduction": "Average diagnosis time reduced from 120 minutes to 12 minutes",
      "escalation reduction": "Escalations reduced by 60%",
      "adoption rate": "Adopted by 1,000+ engineers within 3 months"
    },
    "business_outcome": "Improved field productivity, faster onboarding, reduced downtime and operational costs."
